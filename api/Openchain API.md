# Open Blockchain APIs - CLI, REST, and Node.js

## Overview

This document covers the available APIs for interacting with an Open Blockchain peer node. Three interface choices are provided:

1. [CLI](#open-blockchain-cli)
2. [REST API](#open-blockchain-rest-api)
3. [Node.js Application](#nodejs-application)

**Note:** If you are working with APIs with security enabled, please review the [security setup instructions](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-docs/blob/master/api/SandboxSetup.md#security-setup-optional) before proceeding.

## Open Blockchain CLI:

To view the currently available CLI commands, execute the following:

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer
    ./obc-peer

You will see output similar to the example below (**NOTE:** rootcommand below is hardcoded in [main.go](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/main.go). Currently, the build will create an *obc-peer* executable file).

```
    Usage:
      obc-peer [command]

    Available Commands:
      peer        Run openchain peer.
      status      Status of the openchain peer.
      stop        Stop openchain peer.
      login       Login user on CLI.
      vm          VM functionality of openchain.
      chaincode   chaincode specific commands.
      help        Help about any command

    Flags:
      -h, --help[=false]: help for openchain


    Use "obc-peer [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

The `obc-peer` command supports several subcommands, as shown above. To
facilitate its use in scripted applications, the `obc-peer` command always
produces a non-zero return code in the event of command failure. Upon success,
many of the subcommands produce a result on **stdout** as shown in the table
below:

Command | **stdout** result in the event of success
--- | ---
`peer`   | N/A
`status` | String form of [StatusCode](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/server_admin.proto#L36)
`stop`   | String form of [StatusCode](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/server_admin.proto#L36)
`login`  | N/A
`vm`     | String form of [StatusCode](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/server_admin.proto#L36)
`chaincode deploy` | The chaincode container name (hash) required for subsequent `chaincode invoke` and `chaincode query` commands
`chaincode invoke` | The transaction ID (UUID)
`chaincode query`  | By default, the query result is formatted as a printable string. Command line options support writing this value as raw bytes (-r, --raw), or formatted as the hexadecimal representation of the raw bytes (-x, --hex). If the query response is empty then nothing is output.


### Deploy a Chaincode

Deploy creates the docker image for the chaincode and subsequently deploys the package to the validating peer. An example is below.

`./obc-peer chaincode deploy -p github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain/example/chaincode/chaincode_example02 -c '{"Function":"init", "Args": ["a","100", "b", "200"]}'`

The response to the chaincode deploy command is defined by ChaincodeDeploymentSpec inside [chaincode.proto](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/chaincode.proto).

```
message ChaincodeDeploymentSpec {
    ChaincodeSpec chaincodeSpec = 1;
    // Controls when the chaincode becomes executable.
    google.protobuf.Timestamp effectiveDate = 2;
    bytes codePackage = 3;
}
```

With security enabled, modify the command to include the -u parameter passing the username of a logged in user as follows:

`./obc-peer chaincode deploy -u jim -p github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain/example/chaincode/chaincode_example02 -c '{"Function":"init", "Args": ["a","100", "b", "200"]}'`

### Verify Results

To verify that the block containing the latest transaction has been added to the blockchain, use the `/chain` REST endpoint from the command line. Target the IP address of either a validator or a peer node. In the example below, 172.17.0.2 is the IP address of a validator or a peer node and 5000 is the REST interface port defined in [openchain.yaml](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/openchain.yaml).

`curl 172.17.0.2:5000/chain`

An example of the response is below.

```
{
    "height":1,
    "currentBlockHash":"4Yc4yCO95wcpWHW2NLFlf76OGURBBxYZMf3yUyvrEXs5TMai9qNKfy9Yn/=="
}
```

The returned BlockchainInfo message is defined inside [openchain.proto](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/openchain.proto).

```
message BlockchainInfo {
    uint64 height = 1;
    bytes currentBlockHash = 2;
    bytes previousBlockHash = 3;
}
```

To verify that a specific block is inside the blockchain, use the `/chain/blocks/{Block}` REST endpoint. Likewise, target the IP address of either a validator or a peer node on port 5000.

`curl 172.17.0.2:5000/chain/blocks/0`

The response will have the following form:

```
{
    "transactions":[{
        "type":1,
        "chaincodeID": {
            "path":"github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain/example/chaincode/chaincode_example01"
        },
        "payload":"ClwIARJYCk9naXRod...",
        "uuid":"abdcec99-ae5e-415e-a8be-1fca8e38ba71"
    }],
    "stateHash":"PY5YcQRu2g1vjiAqHHshoAhnq8CFP3MqzMslcEAJbnmXDtD+LopmkrUHrPMOGSF5UD7Kxqhbg1XUjmQAi84paw=="
}
```

The returned Block message structure is defined inside [openchain.proto](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/openchain.proto).

```
message Block {
    uint32 version = 1;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 2;
    repeated Transaction transactions = 3;
    bytes stateHash = 4;
    bytes previousBlockHash = 5;
    bytes consensusMetadata = 6;
    NonHashData nonHashData = 7;
}
```

For additional information on the Open Blockchain CLI commands, please see the OBC protocol specification section on [CLI](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-docs/blob/master/protocol-spec.md#63-cli).

## Open Blockchain REST API:

You can work with the Open Blockchain REST API through any tool of your choice. For example, the curl command line utility or a browser based client such as the Firefox Rest Client or Chrome Postman. You can likewise trigger REST requests directly through [Swagger](http://swagger.io/). You can utilize the Swagger service directly or, if you prefer, you can set up Swagger locally by following the instructions [here](#to-set-up-swagger-ui).

**Note:** The Open Blockchain REST interface port is defined as port 5000 in the [openchain.yaml](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/openchain.yaml). If you are sending REST requests to the peer node from inside Vagrant, use port 5000. If you are sending REST requests through Swagger, the port specified in the Swagger file is port 3000. The different port emphasizes that Swagger will likely run outside of Vagrant. To send requests from the Swagger interface, set up port forwarding from host port 3000 to Vagrant port 5000 on your machine, or edit the Swagger configuration file to specify another  port number of your choice.

**Note on test blockchain** If you want to test the REST APIs locally, construct a test blockchain by running the TestServerOpenchain_API_GetBlockCount test implemented inside [api_test.go](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/openchain/api_test.go). This test will create a test blockchain with 5 blocks. Subsequently restart the peer process.

```
    cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer
    go test -v -run TestServerOpenchain_API_GetBlockCount github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain
```

### REST Endpoints

To learn about the Open Blockchain REST API through Swagger, please take a look at the Swagger document [here](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/openchain/rest/rest_api.json). You can utilize the Swagger service directly or, if you prefer, you can set up Swagger locally by following the instructions [here](#to-set-up-swagger-ui).

* [Block](#block)
  * GET /chain/blocks/{Block}
* [Blockchain](#blockchain)
  * GET /chain
* [Devops](#devops)
  * POST /devops/deploy
  * POST /devops/invoke
  * POST /devops/query
* [Network](#network)
  * GET /network/peers
* [Registrar](#registrar)
  * POST /registrar
  * DELETE /registrar/{enrollmentID}
  * GET /registrar/{enrollmentID}
  * GET /registrar/{enrollmentID}/ecert
  * GET /registrar/{enrollmentID}/tcert
* [Transactions](#transactions)
    * GET /transactions/{UUID}

#### Block

* **GET /chain/blocks/{Block}**

Use the Block API to retrieve the contents of various blocks from the blockchain. The returned Block message structure is defined inside [openchain.proto](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/openchain.proto).

```
message Block {
    uint32 version = 1;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp Timestamp = 2;
    repeated Transaction transactions = 3;
    bytes stateHash = 4;
    bytes previousBlockHash = 5;
}
```

#### Blockchain

* **GET /chain**

Use the Chain API to retrieve the current state of the blockchain. The returned BlockchainInfo message is defined inside [openchain.proto](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/openchain.proto).

```
message BlockchainInfo {
    uint64 height = 1;
    bytes currentBlockHash = 2;
    bytes previousBlockHash = 3;
}
```

#### Devops

* **POST /devops/deploy**
* **POST /devops/invoke**
* **POST /devops/query**

Use the Devops APIs to deploy, invoke, and query chaincodes. The required ChaincodeSpec and ChaincodeInvocationSpec payloads are defined in [chaincode.proto](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/chaincode.proto).

```
message ChaincodeSpec {

    enum Type {
        UNDEFINED = 0;
        GOLANG = 1;
        NODE = 2;
    }

    Type type = 1;
    ChaincodeID chaincodeID = 2;
    ChaincodeInput ctorMsg = 3;
    int32 timeout = 4;
    string secureContext = 5;
    ConfidentialityLevel confidentialityLevel = 6;
}
```

```
message ChaincodeInvocationSpec {
    ChaincodeSpec chaincodeSpec = 1;
    //ChaincodeInput message = 2;
}
```

**Note:** The deploy transaction requires a 'path' parameter to locate the chaincode source-code in the file system, build it, and deploy it to the validating peers. On the other hand, invoke and query transactions require a 'name' parameter to reference the chaincode that has already been deployed. These 'path' and 'name' parameters are specified in the ChaincodeID, defined in [chaincode.proto](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/chaincode.proto). The only exception to the aforementioned rule is when the peer is running in chaincode development mode (as opposed to production mode), i.e. the user starts the peer with `--peer-chaincodedev` and runs the chaincode manually in a separate terminal window. In that case, the deploy transaction requires a 'name' parameter that is specified by the end user.

```
message ChaincodeID {
    //deploy transaction will use the path
    string path = 1;

    //all other requests will use the name (really a hashcode) generated by
    //the deploy transaction
    string name = 2;
}
```

An example of a valid ChaincodeSpec message for a deployment transaction is shown below. The 'path' parameter specifies the location of the chaincode in the filesystem. Eventually, we imagine that the 'path' will represent a location on GitHub.

```
{
    "type": "GOLANG",
    "chaincodeID":{
        "path":"github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain/example/chaincode/chaincode_example02"
    },
    "ctorMsg": {
        "function":"init",
        "args":["a", "100", "b", "200"]
    }
  }
```

An example of a valid ChaincodeInvocationSpec message for an invocation transaction is shown below. Consult [chaincode.proto](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/chaincode.proto) for more information.

```
{
  "chaincodeSpec":{
      "type": "GOLANG",
      "chaincodeID":{
          "name":"mycc"
      },
      "ctorMsg":{
          "function":"invoke",
          "args":["a", "b", "10"]
      }
  }
}
```

With security enabled, modify each of the above payloads to include the secureContext element, passing the enrollmentID of a logged in user as follows:

```
{
  "chaincodeSpec":{
      "type": "GOLANG",
      "chaincodeID":{
          "name":"mycc"
      },
      "ctorMsg":{
          "function":"invoke",
          "args":["a", "b", "10"]
      },
  	  "secureContext": "jim"
  }
}
```

**Note:** The deployment transaction will take a little time as the docker image is being created.

The response to a deploy request is either a message containing a confirmation of successful execution or an error, containing a reason for the failure. The response to a deployment request also contains the assigned chaincode name (hash), which is to be used in subsequent invocation and query transactions. An example is below:

```
{
    "OK": "Successfully deployed chainCode.",
    "message": "3940678a8dff854c5ca4365fe0e29771edccb16b2103578c9d9207fea56b10559b43ff5c3025e68917f5a959f2a121d6b19da573016401d9a028b4211e10b20a"
}
```

The response to an invoke request is either a message containing a confirmation of successful execution or an error, containing a reason for the failure. The response to an invoke request also contains the transaction identifier (UUID). An example is below:

```
{
    "OK": "Successfully invoked chainCode.",
    "message": "1ca30d0c-0153-46b4-8826-26dc7cfff852"
}
```

The response to a query request depends on the chaincode implementation. It may contain a string formatted value of a state variable, any string message, or not have an output. An example is below:

```
{
    "OK": "80"
}

```

#### Network

* **GET /network/peers**

Use the Network APIs to retrieve information about the network of peer nodes comprising the blockchain fabric.

The /network/peers endpoint returns a list of all existing network connections for the target peer node. The list includes both validating and non-validating peers. The list of peers is returned as type `PeersMessage`, containing an array of `PeerEndpoint`.

```
message PeersMessage {
    repeated PeerEndpoint peers = 1;
}
```

```
message PeerEndpoint {
    PeerID ID = 1;
    string address = 2;
    enum Type {
      UNDEFINED = 0;
      VALIDATOR = 1;
      NON_VALIDATOR = 2;
    }
    Type type = 3;
    bytes pkiID = 4;
}
```

```
message PeerID {
    string name = 1;
}
```

#### Registrar

* **POST /registrar**
* **DELETE /registrar/{enrollmentID}**
* **GET /registrar/{enrollmentID}**
* **GET /registrar/{enrollmentID}/ecert**
* **GET /registrar/{enrollmentID}/tcert**

Use the Registrar APIs to manage end user registration with the CA. These API endpoints are used to register a user with the CA, determine whether a given user is registered, and to remove any login tokens for a target user preventing them from executing any further transactions. The Registrar APIs are also used to retrieve user enrollment and transaction certificates from the system.

The /registrar enpoint is used to register a user with the CA. The required Secret payload is defined in [devops.proto](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/devops.proto).

```
message Secret {
    string enrollId = 1;
    string enrollSecret = 2;
}
```

The response to the registration request is either a confirmation of successful registration or an error, containing a reason for the failure. An example of a valid Secret message to register user 'lukas' is shown below.

```
{
  "enrollId": "lukas",
  "enrollSecret": "NPKYL39uKbkj"
}
```

The GET /registrar/{enrollmentID} endpoint is used to confirm whether a given user is registered with the CA. If so, a confirmation will be returned. Otherwise, an authorization error will result.

The DELETE /registrar/{enrollmentID} endpoint is used to delete login tokens for a target user. If the login tokens are deleted successfully, a confirmation will be returned. Otherwise, an authorization error will result. No payload is required for this endpoint.

The GET /registrar/{enrollmentID}/ecert endpoint is used to retrieve the enrollment certificate of a given user from local storage. If the target user has already registered with the CA, the response will include a URL-encoded version of the enrollment certificate. If the target user has not yet registered, an error will be returned. If the client wishes to use the returned enrollment certificate after retrieval, keep in mind that it must be URL-decoded. This can be accomplished with the QueryUnescape method in the "net/url" package.

The /registrar/{enrollmentID}/tcert endpoint retrieves the transaction certificates for a given user that has registered with the certificate authority. If the user has registered, a confirmation message will be returned containing an array of URL-encoded transaction certificates. Otherwise, an error will result. The desired number of transaction certificates is specified with the optional 'count' query parameter. The default number of returned transaction certificates is 1 and 500 is the maximum number of certificates that can be retrieved with a single request. If the client wishes to use the returned transaction certificates after retrieval, keep in mind that they must be URL-decoded. This can be accomplished with the QueryUnescape method in the "net/url" package.

#### Transactions

* **GET /transactions/{UUID}**

Use the /transactions/{UUID} endpoint to retrieve an individual transaction matching the UUID from the blockchain. The returned transaction message is defined inside [openchain.proto](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/protos/openchain.proto) .

```
message Transaction {
    enum Type {
        UNDEFINED = 0;
        CHAINCODE_NEW = 1;
        CHAINCODE_UPDATE = 2;
        CHAINCODE_EXECUTE = 3;
        CHAINCODE_QUERY = 4;
        CHAINCODE_TERMINATE = 5;
    }
    Type type = 1;
    bytes chaincodeID = 2;
    bytes payload = 3;
    string uuid = 4;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 5;

    ConfidentialityLevel confidentialityLevel = 6;
    bytes nonce = 7;

    bytes cert = 8;
    bytes signature = 9;
}
```

For additional information on the Open Blockchain REST endpoints and more detailed examples, please see the OBC protocol specification section on the [REST API](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-docs/blob/master/protocol-spec.md#62-rest-api).

### To set up Swagger-UI

[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is a convenient package that allows you to describe and document your REST API in a single file. The Open Blockchain REST API is described in [rest_api.json](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/openchain/rest/rest_api.json). To interact with the peer node directly through the Swagger-UI, you can upload the Open Blockchain Swagger definition to the [Swagger service](http://swagger.io/). Alternatively, you may set up a Swagger installation on your machine by following the instructions below.

1. You can use Node.js to serve up the rest_api.json locally. To do so, make sure you have Node.js installed on your local machine. If it is not installed, please download the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) package and install it.

2. Install the Node.js http-server package with the command below:

    `npm install http-server -g`

3. Start up an http-server on your local machine to serve up the rest_api.json.

    ```
    cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain/rest
    http-server -a 0.0.0.0 -p 5554 --cors
    ```

4. Make sure that you are successfully able to access the API description document within your browser at this link:

    `http://localhost:5554/rest_api.json`

5. Download the Swagger-UI package with the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui.git`

6. Navigate to the /swagger-ui/dist directory and click on the index.html file to bring up the Swagger-UI interface inside your browser.

7. Start up the peer node with no connections to a leader or validator as follows.

    ```
    cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer
    ./obc-peer peer
    ```

8. If you need to construct a test blockchain on the local peer node, run the the TestServerOpenchain_API_GetBlockCount test implemented inside [api_test.go](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/openchain/api_test.go). This test will create a blockchain with 5 blocks. Subsequently restart the peer process.

    ```
    cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer
    go test -v -run TestServerOpenchain_API_GetBlockCount github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain
    ```

9. Go back to the Swagger-UI interface inside your browser and load the API description. You should now be able to issue queries against the pre-built blockchain directly from Swagger.

## Node.js Application

You can interface with the obc-peer process from a Node.js application. One way to accomplish that is by relying on the Swagger API description document, [rest_api.json](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/openchain/rest/rest_api.json) and the [swagger-js plugin](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js). Another way to accomplish that relies upon the IBM Blockchain [JS SDK](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/ibm-blockchain-js). Use the approach that you find the most convenient.

### [OpenchainSample_1](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-docs/blob/master/api/Openchain%20Samples/openchain_1.js)

* Demonstrates interfacing with a peer node from a Node.js application.
* Utilizes the Node.js swagger-js plugin: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js

**To run:**

1. Build and install [obc-peer](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/blob/master/README.md).

    ```
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer
    go build
    ```

2. Run a local peer node only (not a complete Open Blockchain network) with:

    `./obc-peer peer`

3. Set up a test blockchain data structure (with 5 blocks only) by running a test from within Vagrant as follows. Subsequently restart the peer process.

    ```
    cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer
    go test -v -run TestServerOpenchain_API_GetBlockCount github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain
    ```

4. Set up a Node.js HTTP server to serve up the Open Blockchain API Swagger document:

    ```
    npm install http-server -g
    cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain/rest
    http-server -a 0.0.0.0 -p 5554 --cors
    ```

5. Download and unzip [OpenchainSample_1.zip](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-docs/blob/master/api/Openchain%20Samples/OpenchainSample_1.zip)

    ```
    unzip OpenchainSample_1.zip -d OpenchainSample_1
    cd OpenchainSample_1
    ```

6. Update the api_url variable within [openchain.js](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-docs/blob/master/api/Openchain%20Samples/openchain_1.js) to the appropriate URL if it is not already the default

    `var api_url = 'http://localhost:5554/rest_api.json';`

7. Run the Node.js app

    `node ./openchain.js`

You will observe several responses on the console and the program will appear to hang for a few moments at the end. This is expected, as is it waiting for the invocation transaction to complete in order to then execute a query. You can take a look at the sample output of the program inside the 'openchain_test' file located inside OpenchainSample_1 directory.

### [Marbles Demo](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles)

* Demonstrates an alternative way of interfacing with a peer node from a Node.js app.
* Demonstrates deploying a Blockchain application as a Bluemix service.

Hold on to your hats everyone, this application is going to demonstrate transferring marbles between two users leveraging IBM Blockchain. We are going to do this in Node.js and a bit of GoLang. The backend of this application will be the GoLang code running in our blockchain network. The chaincode itself will create a marble by storing it to the chaincode state. The chaincode itself is able to store data as a string in a key/value pair setup. Thus we will stringify JSON objects to store more complex structures.

For more inforation on the IBM Blockchain marbles demo, set-up, and instructions, please visit [this page](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles).
